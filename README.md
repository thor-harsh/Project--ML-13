# Project--ML-13

**In this project we will build the Model Random Forest Classifier for classifying Purchased as 0(Not Purchased) or 1(Purchased) from different features in the dataset**.<br></br>  

Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. 
It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represents the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.<br></br>
In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.<br></br>
In order to build a tree, we use the CART algorithm, which stands for Classification and Regression Tree algorithm.


**Important- Note: Explore the dataset once before going through the code.**
